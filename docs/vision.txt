The aim of this project is to make a virtual capital market. The individual participants of the market place will be modelled as independent applications that communicate via messaging. The aim would be to learn the domain of capital markets and also model the technical complexities in a suitable manner. The reference used for modelling all participants is the book Securities Operations by Michael Simmons.
